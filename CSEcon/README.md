**Question 3**

**Beyond CS & Econ**: How are aspects of human nature, like bounded rationality, and pioneering technologies, such as generative AI, reshaping the dynamics between humans and AI agents in strategic contexts? Additionally, how might this interplay be perceived and conceptualized distinctively from current models? Address this inquiry by drawing upon the literature covered in our lectures and supplementary scholarly works, ensuring to include in-text citations and a comprehensive bibliography.
# Answers

## Question 1
In the realm where computer science intersects with economics in Quantitative Finance, I aim to be an innovator who uses methods to solve intricate economic challenges. One of my admired Nobel Prize laureates in this field is Robert C. Merton, known for his groundbreaking work on the Black Scholes Merton model, a framework for pricing options and other financial securities (Merton and Scholes 1973). I find inspiration from the realm of computing, in Leslie Lamport, a recipient of the Turing Award, who was celebrated for his contributions to distributed systems (Lamport 1978).
My goal is to contribute at the crossroads of these two disciplines by creating models that can accurately forecast market behaviors and optimize financial strategies. Influenced by Merton's approaches in economics, I plan to refine pricing models and risk management tools to make them more user-friendly and effective for financial institutions. Building on Lamport's achievements in distributed systems, I aim to develop distributed computing systems for managing large volumes of data processed during real-time financial transactions, thereby enhancing the reliability and efficiency of financial markets.
I strive to blend expertise with principles by crafting tools and models proficient at predicting market trends and mitigating risks associated with high-frequency trading and financial derivatives.This project aims to make financial markets more transparent, more effective, and stronger, which could help advance society by fostering stability and progress. This aspiration drives my fascination with cryptocurrency investments, where I plan to use finance concepts to develop direct investment approaches in the volatile yet rapidly growing cryptocurrency sector.


## Question 2
The fusion of computer science and economics serves as a force for driving innovation, leading to progress and a promising future. This connection combines the precision of computer science with the insights of economics to develop technologically advanced and economically sustainable solutions, fostering growth across various industries.  Blending computational algorithms and economic principles helps optimize resources, resulting in better market systems and enhanced economic policies. For example, integrating machine learning models into studies enables economists to analyze datasets and make more accurate predictions about market trends swiftly (Czech 2023). This capability is essential for crafting impactful fiscal strategies in response to rapid economic shifts.
Furthermore, the partnership between computer science and economics has transformed markets by introducing automated trading systems and blockchain technology. Automated trading systems employ algorithms to execute trades at speeds and volumes beyond capacity, thereby boosting market liquidity and efficiency ("Automated Trading Systems," n.d.).Blockchain technology has brought about a way of conducting transactions, offering secure, transparent, and decentralized platforms that aim to reduce fraud, cut down transaction costs, and simplify financial processes. This was discussed in the article "Will Blockchain Technology Mark a Turning Point in Fraud Prevention?" published in 2023.
In policy and governance, computational models and economic simulations serve as tools for policymakers to plan scenarios and make decisions. For instance, during COVID-19, computer-based models played a crucial role in evaluating how different lockdown measures could impact the economy. This helped governments strike a balance, between addressing health concerns and maintaining stability as mentioned by Guerini et al. In 2024.

## Question 3
The interaction, between bounded rationality and generative AI is reshaping how strategic decisions are made. Human decision making, limited by bounded rationality differs from AIs ability to quickly process and analyze amounts of data. Generative AI, specifically enhances these capabilities by devising intricate strategies. This fusion of intuition and AIs analytical prowess is nurturing hybrid decision making models that improve the effectiveness of strategic decisions across different sectors such, as finance and policymaking. The convergence of these two decision making entities highlights the importance of understanding their potential intricately and the ethical considerations surrounding their collaboration as discussed in Nilssons (1996) thorough analysis.
