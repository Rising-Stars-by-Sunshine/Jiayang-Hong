## About Me
My name is Jiayang Hong, and I am a junior at Duke Kunshan University, majoring in data science with a deep interest in machine learning and cryptocurrency. Alongside my academic pursuits, I am passionate about sports, dedicating much of my spare time to weight training. Also I used to be a player at Duke rugby club,which I found both challenging and rewarding.
## Intellectual Growth
Throughout this course, my intellectual capabilities expanded significantly, especially in understanding how machine learning, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), can be applied to solve social and economic issues through game theory. Reinforcement learning involves agents learning optimal behaviors within a defined environment by actions and consequences, akin to strategic decision-making in game theory. By simulating game scenarios, RL algorithms optimize decision-making processes, reflecting real-world strategic interactions. This exploration not only deepened my comprehension of dynamic strategic models but also highlighted the transformative potential of interdisciplinary research in merging AI with economic theories.

## Professional Growth
My professional growth during the course was marked by acquiring a robust combination of technical skills and strategic insights. Engaging with complex algorithms and modeling techniques has equipped me with the tools necessary to design and implement AI-driven strategies in varied professional settings. This skill set is crucial for developing systems that require adaptive learning and decision-making capabilities, preparing me for challenges in AI applications in economics and beyond.

## Living a Purposeful Life
Looking ahead, I aspire to be a pioneer in integrating artificial intelligence with human-centric economic strategies. Imagine being acknowledged with a Nobel Prize or Turing Award; I envision my contribution statement to reflect my commitment to advancing AI in economic models to better serve societal needs. My goal is to create systems that not only optimize outcomes but also enhance human welfare globally, representing a significant advancement in how we understand and implement AI in complex decision-making landscapes.
