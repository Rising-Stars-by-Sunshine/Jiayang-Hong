# Integrating GAI and Human strategy: A New Paradigm in Game Theory

## Background/Motivation
The digital economy and complex systems involving both human and AI agents reveal substantial gaps in traditional game theory. Traditional models do not dynamically represent real-time strategic interactions adequately. This project aims to develop a more robust theoretical model that incorporates unpredictable interactions between AI and humans, particularly useful in sectors like cybersecurity and automated trading systems.

## Research Questions
- How can game theory be adapted to better integrate the capabilities of General Artificial Intelligence (GAI) within systems involving human agents?
- What strategies can enable effective cooperation between AI and human agents in complex decision-making environments?
- Why are these questions critical for advancing our understanding of strategic AI integration into societal frameworks?
- What limitations in existing game theory models prevent them from addressing these dynamic interactions?

## Application Scenario
This framework applies to scenarios such as autonomous vehicle navigation systems and AI-mediated negotiation platforms, where instantaneous and high-impact decisions are common. Insights from behavioral economics and psychology provide foundational support for designing AI behaviors that are predictable and trustworthy for human operators.

## Methodology
This project leverages advanced game-theoretical models like Bayesian Nash Equilibria and computational tools such as reinforcement learning to simulate and analyze AI-human interactions. This interdisciplinary approach utilizes real-time learning algorithms to adapt and respond to human decision-making patterns.

## Preliminary Results
We provide an illustrative example with the Centipede Game, adapted for AI-mediated negotiations. This example demonstrates improved strategic cooperation and decision-making outcomes, highlighting the practical benefits of this research in real-world applications.

## Intellectual Merits and Practical Impacts
The research introduces groundbreaking theoretical advancements and acknowledges its limitations in fully predicting long-term AI-human interactions, paving the way for further exploration. The findings are poised to influence strategic decision-making across multiple sectors, enhancing the efficacy of policy-making and governance through sophisticated AI integration.
